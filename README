This OOT module contains experimental code on integration of GPU processing into
GNU Radio by using the PyCUDA library to run CUDA code from within GNU Radio.

For more information or to report bugs/issues please contact
support@deepwavedigital.com.

# Current Blocks
-> gpu_kernel.py: This is a Python block that runs an arbitrary CUDA kernel from
                  within GNU Radio. Currently the CUDA kernel simply divides
                  every sample by two, but this can be changed by the end user
                  if desired.
